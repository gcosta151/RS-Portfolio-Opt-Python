 This repository contains the source code to conduct numerical experiments similar to those presented in the following two papers:

The work in these two papers pertains to a Markov regime-switching factor model that captures the cyclical nature of asset returns in modern financial markets. Maintaining a factor model structure allows us to easily derive the first two moments of the asset return distribution: the expected returns and covariance matrix. By design, these two parameters are calibrated under the assumption of having distinct market regimes. In turn, these regime-dependent parameters serve as the inputs during portfolio optimization, thereby constructing portfolios adapted to the current market environment. The proposed framework leads to a computationally tractable portfolio optimization problem, meaning we can construct large, realistic portfolios. 

## Dependencies ##
- Python v3.x
- pandas v2.0.x

## Usage ##
This repository contains all the files used to necessary to run the numerical experiments of the regime-switching portfolio optimization framework. To run the experiments. please refer to the main.py file. Anyone wishing to make any changes to the models may do so by tinkering with a copy of the code base. The code base is composed of the following files:
- dataload.py: Module to download data from [Kenneth French's data library](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html). Use this module to download feature returns from the Fama-French model, as well as the Industry Portfolios to serve as the asset returns.
- portfolio.py: Library with the Portfolio object, as well as the backtest function to evaluate multiple competing portfolios over time. 
- optimization.py: Library to construct optimal nominal and regime-switching portfolios. Three portfolio optimization models are currently available for use. The optimization models can be used to construct both nominal and regime-switching portfolios. 
   - mvo: Mean-variance optimization
   - minvar: Minimum variance optimization
   - rp: Risk parity portfolio optimization
- hmm.py: Library with the HMM object. The HMM object takes in time series data and implements the Baum-Welch algorithm to fit a hidden Markov model. 
- factormodel.py: Library with the FactorModel object. The FactorModel object is calibrated using linear regression (OLS) under both a single regime, as well as under the assumption of multiple regimes.
